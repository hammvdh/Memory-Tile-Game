# Memory-Tile-Game

### ABC Pairs is a memory game where you need to match pairs of tiles (based on the underneath value or the picture).

Playing is very simple - you turn over one tile and then try to find a matching tile, i.e. either the corresponding value or the picture.

There are 2 levels in this game. 
* For Level one, the player will be getting 60 seconds to match 6 pairs of letters, numbers or pictures. 
* In Level 2, the Tiles will be revealed initially for about 8 seconds, this makes it harder to score a perfect recall as it assumes you remember where each tile is.

Each time you make a successful match you score 20 points, if you fail to make a match you score (-5 * number of times match tile has been shown). So, for example, if a matching tile has been revealed four times prior, the player will score -20
